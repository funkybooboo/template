# CODEOWNERS
#
# Defines who is automatically requested for review when a pull request
# touches specific files or directories.
#
# Rules are matched top-to-bottom; the last matching rule wins.
# Patterns follow the same syntax as .gitignore.
#
# Docs: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Setup
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Replace @username with real GitHub usernames or @org/team-slug values.
# 2. Uncomment the rules you want to enforce.
# 3. CODEOWNERS only takes effect when branch protection requires code owner
#    review. Enable that in: Settings -> Branches -> Require review from
#    Code Owners.
