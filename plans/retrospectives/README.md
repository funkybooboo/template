# Retrospectives

Written after each release or sprint. Short, honest, and actionable.

Name files by date and version: `YYYY-MM-v0.1.0.md`.

## Why Write Retrospectives?

- Capture what worked so you can repeat it
- Surface what didn't work so you can fix it
- Create a record of how the team and process evolved
- Hold yourself accountable to the improvements you commit to

## Retrospective Template

```markdown
# Retrospective: v0.1.0 -- 2024-01-31

## Metrics

## Notes

[Anything else worth capturing]
```

## Tips

- Write it while the release is fresh -- don't wait a week
- Be specific: "PRs took too long to review" is less useful than "3 PRs sat unreviewed for >3 days"
- Action items need owners and deadlines, or they won't happen
- Keep it short -- a retrospective that takes an hour to write won't get written
