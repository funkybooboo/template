# US-001: Example Story

> **Delete this file** and replace it with your first real user story.
> See the [README](./README.md) for the template and naming convention.

## Story

**As a** new contributor
**I want** a clear example of how to write a user story
**So that** I can follow the same format and get my feature reviewed quickly

## Context

Without a concrete example, contributors write stories in inconsistent formats.
This makes them harder to review and harder to turn into acceptance tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Story has a clear role, capability, and benefit
**Given** I am writing a new user story
**When** I fill in the story template
**Then** the story clearly states who benefits, what they can do, and why it matters

### AC2: Acceptance criteria map to tests
**Given** a completed user story
**When** a developer reads the acceptance criteria
**Then** they can write an E2E test for each criterion without ambiguity

## Business Rules

- BR1: Every story must have at least one acceptance criterion
- BR2: Acceptance criteria use Given/When/Then format
- BR3: Stories describe user value, not implementation details

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria pass
- [ ] E2E tests written for each AC
- [ ] Unit tests written for business logic
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
