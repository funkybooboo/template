# ADR-001: Example Architecture Decision Record

> **Delete this file** and replace it with your first real ADR.
> See the [README](./README.md) for the template and naming convention.

## Status

Accepted

## Context

New contributors need a concrete example of what an ADR looks like so they can
write their own without guessing at the format or level of detail expected.

Without examples, ADRs either don't get written or get written inconsistently,
making the decision history hard to navigate.

## Decision

Include an example ADR in the template repository that demonstrates the format,
level of detail, and tone expected.

## Rationale

- A concrete example is more useful than a template alone
- The example can be deleted once the first real ADR is written
- Keeping it simple reduces the barrier to writing ADRs

## Consequences

### Positive
- Contributors have a clear reference for the expected format
- Reduces back-and-forth in code review over ADR style
- Encourages the habit of writing ADRs from day one

### Negative
- Someone has to remember to delete this file (low risk -- it says so at the top)

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Template only, no example**: Rejected -- templates without examples are often misinterpreted
2. **Detailed style guide**: Rejected -- overkill; a good example communicates more than rules
