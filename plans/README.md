| [`stories/`](./stories/) | User stories with acceptance criteria |

## How to Use This Directory

**Starting a new feature?**
1. Write a user story in `stories/` -- define the problem and acceptance criteria first
2. If the implementation is complex, write a technical spec in `specs/`
3. If you're making a significant architectural decision, write an ADR in `decisions/`

**Finishing a release?**
Write a retrospective in `retrospectives/` -- what went well, what didn't, what to change.

**Looking for context on a past decision?**
Check `decisions/` -- every significant architectural choice should be documented there.
