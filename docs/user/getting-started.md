# Getting Started

<!-- This file is for end users -- people who install and use your project,
     not people who build or contribute to it.

     Write for someone who has never seen the source code.
     Lead with what they can accomplish, not how it works internally.

     Replace every [placeholder] with real content before shipping. -->

Welcome to [Project Name]. This guide will get you up and running in a few minutes.

## What You'll Need

<!-- List only what the user must have before they can install or run this project.
     Keep it short. Link to install instructions for anything non-obvious. -->

- [Requirement 1] -- [why it's needed and where to get it]
- [Requirement 2] -- [why it's needed and where to get it]

## Installation

<!-- Describe the simplest path to a working installation.
     If there are multiple install methods (package manager, binary, source),
     lead with the recommended one and list others below. -->

**Option 1 -- [Recommended method, e.g. package manager]:**

```bash
# Replace with the real install command
[install command]
```

**Option 2 -- [Alternative method, e.g. download binary]:**

```bash
# Replace with the real install command
[install command]
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
[project-name] --version
```

## First Run

<!-- Walk through the minimum steps to get something working.
     Show real output where it helps. -->

**1. [First step]:**

```bash
[command]
```

**2. [Second step]:**

```bash
[command]
```

You should see:

```
[expected output]
```

## Basic Usage

<!-- Cover the most common tasks a new user will want to do.
     One section per task. Lead with the task name, not the command name. -->

### [Task 1, e.g. "Create a new project"]

```bash
[command and flags]
```

### [Task 2, e.g. "Run in watch mode"]

```bash
[command and flags]
```

### [Task 3]

```bash
[command and flags]
```

## Configuration

<!-- Describe how users configure the project.
     If config is optional, say so. If there are required values, be explicit. -->

<!-- If configuration is done via a file: -->
Configuration lives in `[config file path]`. Copy the example to get started:

```bash
cp [config.example] [config]
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `[option]` | `[default]` | [what it controls] |
| `[option]` | `[default]` | [what it controls] |

<!-- If configuration is done via environment variables, use this table instead:
| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VAR_NAME` | Yes | -- | [what it controls] |
-->
